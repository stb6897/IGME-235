        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            Jak and Daxter are two mischievous village friends who, in spite of the wise (but grumpy) sage, Samos'
            warning sneak off to Misty Island. There Daxter accidentally falls into a pool of evil Dark Eco, and
            transforms into a weasel-like creature. Bringing Daxter to his original human form is enough of a problem,
            and now the Lurkers are using this Dark Eco for their own malign intentions. The plot goes on as the game
            plays.
            Our hero(es) can jump, double-jump, spin-kick, uppercut, hang onto things, and ride various vehicles and an
            occasional creature along the way to complete their assigned tasks. There are also several NPCs to interact
            with and play their side quests and mini-games.
