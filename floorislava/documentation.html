        <h1>Proposal & Documentation</h1>
    </header>

    <h2>General Concept</h2>
    <p>This game takes the idea of the floor being lava and turns it into a 2D platformer where the player must jump
        from platform to platform as the lava slowly rises. If you've played the game Doodle Jump before, this idea is
        essentially that but with lava that rises.</p>

        Jump</a>
    <h2>Genre</h2>
    <p>This game is a platformer.</p>

    <h2>Platform</h2>
    <p>This game will be designed for desktop only however could have mobile functionality in the future.
    </p>

    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>There isn't much story to this title. You are basically a doodled sketch trying to not get burnt to a crisp.</p>

    <h2>Graphics & Sound</h2>
    <p>I am going to a very cartoon style aesthetic. I want the game to look like a sketch out of someone's notebook.

        For sound, I want to match the graphics and go with cartoon reminiscent sounds.</p>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>The player will have to move upwards from platform to platform as the lava rises. The game will not have a
        concrete end but will instead show a score of how long the player lasted. There will also be power-ups to help
        the player ascend faster.</p>
    <h2>Controls</h2>
    <p>They will be able to move left, right, and up using either WASD or Arrow Keys.</p>
    <h2>Instructions & Learning</h2>
    <p>Besides telling the player the controls there will not be much instruction for playing the game. The goal is
        simple, don't touch the lava. As the player explores the game they will become better with the mechanics and get
        higher scores.</p>

    <h2>Other</h2>
    <p>I am using PIXI.js as an external library.</p>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        I am Sevan Buechele, a second-year Game Design & Development student. I am an experienced programmer with a
        strong understanding of design principles.
    </p>

    <h2>Development Process</h2>
    <p>
        I first began by implementing a rudimentary physics engine and camera system. This took about half the time of
        development and involved me programming things such as collision detection & resolution, vectors, entities that
        have a position, velocity, and acceleration, and a camera that displays sprites relative to in game positions.
        If you look at the prototype for this project you will see that's about where I was at that milestone. I had
        made a nice little sandbox environment to test out everything and refine it. The second stage of development was
        adding in the main game mechanics like spawning in platforms and moving the lava upwards towards the player. I
        also at this stage implemented hud with a timer and a start and end screen. The last and final stage was adding
        in custom textures and sounds. I made a couple of the textures and sourced the rest (see credits). I also found
        some sound effects and a music track to loop to give the game more tension.
    </p>
    <h2>How this project meets the requirements.</h2>
    <p>
        I met all of the requirements. For one, I used one of the tech stacks to make an engaging platformer that is
        easy to understand and goes above and beyond by having physics and collisions that are smooth and air-tight. I
        created multiple ES6 classes and have nice looking graphics with a camera that pans around in a pleasing manner.
        There are no errors, the HTML and CSS are acceptable and validate, and the code is commented on and organized
        well.
