        <h1>The Floor Is Lava!</h1>
    </header>

    <h2>General Concept</h2>
    <p>This game takes the idea of the floor being lava and turns it into a 2D platformer where the player must jump
        from platform to platform as the lava slowly rises. If you've played the game Doodle Jump before, this idea is
        essentially that but with lava that rises.</p>

        Jump</a>
    <h2>Genre</h2>
    <p>This game is a platformer.</p>

    <h2>Platform</h2>
    <p>This game will be designed for desktop only however could have mobile functionality in the future.
    </p>

    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>There isn't much story to this title. You are basically a doodled sketch trying to not get burnt to a crisp.</p>

    <h2>Graphics & Sound</h2>
    <p>I am going to a very cartoon style aesthetic. I want the game to look like a sketch out of someone's notebook.

        For sound, I want to match the graphics and go with cartoon reminiscent sounds.</p>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>The player will have to move upwards from platform to platform as the lava rises. The game will not have a
        concrete end but will instead show a score of how long the player lasted. There will also be power-ups to help
        the player ascend faster.</p>
    <h2>Controls</h2>
    <p>They will be able to move left, right, and up using either WASD or Arrow Keys.</p>
    <h2>Instructions & Learning</h2>
    <p>Besides telling the player the controls there will not be much instruction for playing the game. The goal is
        simple, don't touch the lava. As the player explores the game they will become better with the mechanics and get
        higher scores.</p>
