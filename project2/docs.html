        <h2>Initial Idea Phase:</h2>

        <p>
            Initially, I wanted to have a single image of a dog with a random button. The user could then see what kind
            of dog came up, and if they liked the breed of dog they could search for more of that kind. I've essentially
            done that however what's different from the initial idea is there was a second page. Mine only has one page
            but instead, it dynamically changes the elements depending on what mode it's in.
        </p>



        <h2>Prototype Phase:</h2>
        <p> In this phase, there was just a random button and an image that would update when you pressed the button.
            There was also a preliminary dropdown box where you could pick a breed and search. The theme was also green
            at the time. There was quite a bit of whitespace so I tried to get rid of most of it in the final project.
        </p>


        <h2>Final Phase:</h2>
        In the final phase, I put a lot more effort into the style of the website. I changed up the color scheme
        with something a bit more fun and added animations to the buttons. This is also when I implemented the
        multiple-image display. At first, I wanted to add a carousel but I decided to dynamically move around the
        content instead of new pages. For the images themselves, you may have noticed that they are all a uniform
        size.

        After doing some research I was able to essentially crop the images in a square. I then did a CSS path clip.

        I played around with this site but ultimately went with a simple circle. I also added a nice shadow to let
        the images pop.

        <h2>How I met the requirements:</h2>
        The amount and breed options are saved and loaded.<br>
        There are 3 controls (the dog API only has 3 changeable aspects anyway).<br>
        The CSS and HTML are nice looking and responsive.<br>
        The JS doesn't use any deprecated functions and is formatted and commented well.<br>
        Everything validates.
        <br>
        <h2>Overall Grade:</h2>
        I am very happy with the end result and I met the requirements.<br>
        I would give myself an A.
