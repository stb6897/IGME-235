                <h2>Portfolio Goal</h2>
                <p>
                    My goal with this portfolio is to show the projects that I am most proud of so that employers can
                    see my experience.
                </p>
                <h2>Audience</h2>
                <p>The audience for my portfolio is anyone who is interested in my professional career. So this could be
                    employers, family, mentors, etc.</p>
                <h2>Content I Want To Include</h2>
                <p>I would like to include projects that involved both my work done at school and my experiences outside
                    of school. For example this could be games or mods that represent my experience as a programmer and
                    game developer. I've also included my resume and contact information if anyone wants to reach out to
                    me.</p>
                <h2>How Is My Content Organized?</h2>
                <p>
                    I have a nice header at the top that includes my name, tagline, and a navigation bar. This is then
                    followed by a picture of me and an about section. I then have a nice list of projects with an image
                    on the left and text on the right. Lastly there is a footer at the bottom with contact info.
                </p>
