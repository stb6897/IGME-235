                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Hi! My name is Sevan and I am a 2nd-year GDD student. My goals are to either work as a game dev at an
                    already established studio or to start my own indie studio. I began learning game development about
                    7 years ago by making mods for various games. I eventually got into making more stand-alone titles
                    and which is where I am today. I hope by taking IGME-235 I can sharpen my HTML and CSS skills and
                    learn JavaScript. I also hope we can do some back end web development. I plan on graduating in 2023
                    with a major in GDD and possibly a minor in business.
                </p>

                    <h2>The Floor Is Lava!</h2>
                    <p>The Floor Is Lava was a project made for a web tech class using a tech stack known as PixiJS.
                        It's a small little platformer where you have to climb from platform to platform in order to
                        escape the lava. I was the sole developer of this project and learned how to program collision
                        resolution and strengthened my javascript skills.</p>

                    <h2>Crunch Time</h2>
                    <p>Crunch Time is a 2D top-down shooter that allows you to slow down time when you stop moving. The
                        technologies used were Microsoft XNA and my role in the project was programming the physics for
                        the game. This was one of the first projects I've done that could be considered a full
                        standalone game.</p>

                    <h2>Asteroids</h2>
                    <p>Asteroids is a remake of an old arcade game where you have to break apart asteroids by shooting
                        them. I built this game in the Unity game engine and was the sole developer of the game. I was
                        able to learn more about Unity's engine through this project.</p>
